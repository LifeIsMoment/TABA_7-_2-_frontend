# npm resolution error report

While resolving: my-firebase-project@1.0.0
Found: firebase@11.3.0
node_modules/firebase
  firebase@"^11.3.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer firebase@"^10.0.0" from @firebase/rules-unit-testing@3.0.4
node_modules/@firebase/rules-unit-testing
  dev @firebase/rules-unit-testing@"^3.0.1" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
